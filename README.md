This is an experiment to see if we can model interactions of molecules (and substances) from the ground up using relatively simple physics.
The idea is to have atoms/molecules/groups of molecules interact as Actors, using reactive principles.
Synchronization will most likely happen with time-synchronization, but we're not even close to that one.
